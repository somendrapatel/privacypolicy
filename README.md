# PRIVACY POLICY
 
Phonon Communications Pvt. Ltd. (“Phonon”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that we may obtain through the use of Phonon products such as Click-to-Call, CCNow, 22North, DealerConnect (Applications) and access to www.phonon.in, referred to as (“Site”). The use of information provided through our Platform is limited to the purpose of providing you the service for which the customer has engaged Phonon.  By using our Site and Applications you acknowledge that you have reviewed and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@phonon.in.
 
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect new technologies, your needs, and business developments. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
 
Personally Identifiable Information
 
We define personally identifiable information (or “PII”) as “information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single person or can be used with other sources to uniquely identify a single individual.” e. g. name, address, social security number, e-mail address etc. This is the common industry definition used by most Internet companies. Information that is collected by various Internet companies, but which does not qualify as PII is called “non-PII.”
 
Certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information would be considered a part of your Personally Identifiable Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. However, the same pieces of information are considered Non-Personally Identifiable Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Personally Identifiable Information (for example, your viewing preferences).
 
 
Information Collection and Use
 
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve your relationship with Phonon, including communication features and capabilities, to administer your account, and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site, Applications and Services.  Do not submit any personal information if you are less than 18 years of age.

If the ownership of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new ownership, which will be required to honour the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.
 
Tracking Technologies
 
As is the case with most Sites, we gather certain information automatically which is then stored in log files.  This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or click through data.  We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you for the purposes of improving our products, marketing, analytics and/or Site functionality.
 
Phonon and our third-party partners such as services providers use technologies such as cookies and web beacons.  By using our Site, you accept the use of these tracking technologies.
 
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website. Cookies can be used on mobile applications as well. Cookies can be read or edited when the user loads a website or advertisement from the domain that wrote the cookie in the first place. Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s visit – for example, number of visits to the application, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics. This information can be used to improve a user’s online experience by saving passwords or allowing companies to track and improve website loading times, for instance. Cookies can also be used to track a user’s browsing or online purchasing habits and to target advertisements to specific users. Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a user’s mobile device, to personally identify them, or to act like malware or a virus. Users who prefer not to accept cookies on the web can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive. You can read more about cookies at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/.
 
Web beacons are a clear graphic image of 1×1 pixel that is delivered through a web browser usually as part of a webpage request or an email. Web beacons operate as a tag that records an end users interaction with a web site or email.
 
Permissible Use

While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don’t share information we receive about you with others unless we have:
 
received your permission;
given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or
removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.
 
Third Party Services That You Access

Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared. Please note that third-party sites and applications that you access may use cookies and track your information as well. When using third party services, we suggest you familiarize yourself with their privacy policies and terms and conditions.
 
Other

We may make your personally identifiable information available to other companies, applications or people. For example, we may share:
 
Information you allow us to share when you register with us, or through a subsequent affirmative election.
 
Information used when and if we hire or partner with third parties to provide specialized services on our behalf, such as credit card processing, data processing, customer/support services and other products or services that we choose to make available to our Users.
 
We may share your information with a third party when we jointly offer a service or a feature with that third party, such as connectivity with other websites or applications.
 
We may share your information in order to (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Phonon, our business partners, employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Phonon users or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.
 
We may de-identify personally identifiable information and share it in a de-identified or aggregated form with third parties, advertisers and/or business partners in order to analyse and improve performance of our Platform, Application, and/or Site. The use and disclosure of such information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy.
 
Notifications and Other Messages
 
If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by publication here.
If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances.
 
Aggregate and Non-Personally Identifiable Information
 
We may share aggregated information that does not include Personally Identifiable Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Personally Identifiable Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personally Identifiable Information.
 
Service Providers
 
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Platform and Application available therein, to provide our products on our behalf (“Service Providers”). The types of Service Providers we use may include website and application maintenance, hosting, database management, data analytics and administration. These third parties may have access to your Personally Identifiable Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
 
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement
 
Phonon cooperates with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to injunctions/subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Phonon or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable. We reserve the right to do any of the foregoing.
 
Security
 
Phonon is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We use our best commercial efforts to employ limited data security measures, such as encryption, on some but not all systems. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Phonon strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, Phonon cannot guarantee its absolute security. Do not provide your Personally Identifiable Information if you are concerned with its disclosure. We do our best to keep your information secure. We try to keep Phonon products bug-free and safe, but do not make guarantees about our products.
 
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via e-mail in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
 
Access to Information
 
If your personal information changes you may email us to have it corrected, updated, amended or removed at privacy@phonon.in.  We will respond to your request within a reasonable time. We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
